DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.1	DE.1  Implement a PCI DSS compliance program.	DE.1.2	DE.1.2 A formal PCI DSS compliance program must be in place to include:    Definition of activities for maintaining and monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance, including business-as-usual activities    Annual PCI DSS assessment processes    Processes for the continuous validation of PCI DSS requirements (for example: daily, weekly, quarterly, etc. as applicable per requirement)    A process for performing business- impact analysis to determine potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business decisions PCI DSS Reference: Requirements 1-12	DE.1.2.a Examine information security policies and procedures to verify that processes are specifically defined for the following:    Maintaining and monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance, including business-as-usual activities    Annual PCI DSS assessment(s)    Continuous validation of PCI DSS requirements    Business-impact analysis to determine potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business decisions DE.1.2.b Interview personnel and observe compliance activities to verify that the defined processes are implemented for the following:    Maintaining and monitoring overall PCI DSS compliance, including business-as-usual activities    Annual PCI DSS assessment(s)    Continuous validation of PCI DSS requirements    Business-impact analysis to determine potential PCI DSS impacts for strategic business decisions	A formal compliance program allows an organization to monitor the health of its security controls, be proactive in the event that a control fails, and effectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization. The PCI DSS compliance program can be a dedicated program or part of an over-arching compliance and/or governance program, and should include a well-defined methodology that demonstrates consistent and effective evaluation. Example methodologies include: Deming Circle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six Sigma. Maintaining and monitoring an organization’s overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually, and ensuring these activities are being performed accordingly (for example, using a security self- assessment or PDCA methodology). Examples of strategic business decisions that should be analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may include mergers and acquisitions, new technology purchases, or new payment- acceptance channels.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.1	DE.1  Implement a PCI DSS compliance program.

The formal definition of specific PCI DSS compliance roles and responsibilities helps to ensure accountability and monitoring of ongoing PCI DSS compliance efforts. These roles may be assigned to a single owner or multiple owners for different aspects. Ownership should be assigned to individuals with the authority to make risk-based decisions and upon whom accountability rests for the specific function. Duties should be formally defined and owners should be able to demonstrate an understanding of their responsibilities and accountability.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.1	DE.1  Implement a PCI DSS compliance program.	DE.1.4	DE.1.4 Provide up-to-date PCI DSS and/or information security training at least annually to personnel with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities (as identified in DE.1.3). PCI DSS Reference: Requirement 12	DE.1.4.a Examine information security policies and procedures to verify that PCI DSS and/or information security training is required at least annually for each role with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities. DE.1.4.b Interview personnel and examine certificates of attendance or other records to verify that personnel with PCI DSS compliance responsibility receive up-to- date PCI DSS and/or similar information security training at least annually.	Personnel responsible for PCI DSS compliance have specific training needs exceeding that which is typically provided by general security awareness training. Individuals with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities should receive specialized training that, in addition to general awareness of information security, focuses on specific security topics, skills, processes, or methodologies that must be followed for those individuals to perform their compliance responsibilities effectively. Training may be offered by third parties—for example, SANS or PCI SSC (PCI Awareness, PCIP, and ISA), payment brands and acquirers—or training may be internal. Training content should be applicable for the particular job function and be current to include the latest security threats and/or version of PCI DSS. For additional guidance on developing appropriate security training content for specialized roles, refer to the PCI SSC’s information supplement on Best Practices for Implementing a Security Awareness Program.		0

DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.2	DE.2.2 Determine PCI DSS scope impact for all changes to systems or networks, including additions of new systems and new network connections. Processes must include:    Performing a formal PCI DSS impact assessment    Identifying applicable PCI DSS requirements to the system or network    Updating PCI DSS scope as appropriate    Documented sign-off of the results of the impact assessment by responsible personnel (as defined in DE.1.3) PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements; Requirements 1-12	DE.2.2 Examine change documentation and interview personnel to verify that for each change to systems or networks:    A formal PCI DSS impact assessment was performed.    PCI DSS requirements applicable to the system or network changes were identified.    PCI DSS scope was updated as appropriate for the change.    Sign-off by responsible personnel (as defined in DE.1.3) was obtained and documented.	Changes to systems or networks can have significant impact to PCI DSS scope. For example, firewall rule changes can bring whole network segments into scope, or new systems may be added to the CDE that have to be appropriately protected. Processes to determine the potential impact that changes to systems and networks may have on an entity’s PCI DSS scope may be performed as part of a dedicated PCI DSS compliance program, or may fall under an entity’s over-arching compliance and/or governance program.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.2.1	DE.2.2.1 Upon completion of a change, all relevant PCI DSS requirements must be verified on all new or changed systems and networks, and documentation must be updated as applicable. Examples of PCI DSS requirements that should be verified include, but are not limited to:   Network diagram is updated to reflect changes.   Systems are configured per configuration standards, with all default passwords changed and unnecessary services disabled.   Systems are protected with required controls—e.g., file-integrity monitoring (FIM), anti-virus, patches, audit logging.   Verify that sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored and that all cardholder data (CHD) storage is documented and incorporated into data-retention policy and procedures   New systems are included in the quarterly vulnerability scanning process. PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements; Requirement 1-12	DE.2.2.1 For a sample of systems and network changes, examine change records, interview personnel and observe the affected systems/networks to verify that applicable PCI DSS requirements were implemented and documentation updated as part of the change.	It is important to have processes to analyze all changes made to ensure that all appropriate PCI DSS controls are applied to any systems or networks added to the in-scope environment due to a change. Building this validation into a change management processes helps ensure that device inventories and configuration standards are kept up to date, and security controls are applied where needed. A change-management process should include supporting evidence that PCI DSS requirements are implemented or preserved through the iterative process.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.3	DE.2.3 Changes to organizational structure— for example, a company merger or acquisition, change or reassignment of personnel with responsibility for security controls—result in a formal (internal) review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls. PCI DSS Reference: Requirement 12	DE.2.3 Examine policies and procedures to verify that a change to organizational structure results in formal review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls.	An organization’s structure and management define the requirements and protocol for effective and secure operations. Changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported PCI DSS controls or inheriting new responsibilities that may not have established controls in place. Therefore, it is important to revisit PCI DSS scope and controls when there are changes to ensure controls are in place and active.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.4	DE.2.4 If segmentation is used, confirm PCI DSS scope by performing penetration testing on segmentation controls at least every six months and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods. PCI DSS Reference: Requirement 11	DE.2.4 Examine the results from the most recent penetration test to verify that:    Penetration testing is performed to verify segmentation controls at least every six months and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods.    The penetration testing covers all segmentation controls/methods in use.    The penetration testing verifies that segmentation controls/methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CD.	If segmentation is used to isolate in-scope networks from out-of-scope networks, those segmentation controls must be verified using penetration testing to confirm they continue to operate as intended and effectively. Penetration-testing techniques should follow the existing penetration methodology as specified in PCI DSS Requirement 11. For additional information on effective penetration testing, refer to the PCI SSC’s information supplement on Penetration Testing Guidance.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.5	DE.2.5 Implement a data-discovery methodology to confirm PCI DSS scope and to locate all sources and locations of clear- text PAN at least quarterly, and upon significant changes to the cardholder environment or processes. Data-discovery methodology must take into consideration the potential for clear-text PAN to reside on systems and networks outside of the currently defined CD. PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements	DE.2.5.a Examine documented data-discovery methodology to verify the following:    Data-discovery methodology includes processes for identifying all sources and locations of clear- text PAN.    Methodology takes into consideration the potential for clear-text PAN to reside on systems and networks outside of the currently defined CD. DE.2.5.b Examine results from recent data discovery efforts, and interview responsible personnel to verify that data discovery is performed at least quarterly and upon significant changes to the cardholder environment or processes.	PCI DSS requires that, as part of the scoping exercise, assessed entities must identify and document the existence of all clear-text PAN in their environments. Implementing a data- discovery methodology that identifies all sources and locations of clear-text PAN, and takes into consideration the potential for clear- text PAN to reside on systems and networks outside of the currently defined CDE or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—for example, in an error log or memory dump file— helps to ensure that previously unknown locations of clear-text PAN are detected and properly secured. A data-discovery process can be performed via a variety of methods, including but not limited to: (1) commercially available data-discovery software, (2) an in-house developed data- discovery program, or (3) a manual search. Regardless of the method used, the goal of the effort is to find all sources and locations of clear-text PAN (not just in the defined CDE).		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.2	DE.2  Document and validate PCI DSS scope.	DE.2.5.1	DE.2.5.1 Ensure effectiveness of methods used for data discovery—–e.g., methods must be able to discover clear-text PAN on all types of system components (for example, on each operating system or platform) and file formats in use. The effectiveness of data-discovery methods must be confirmed at least annually. PCI DSS Reference: Scope of PCI DSS Requirements	DE.2.5.1.a Interview personnel and review documentation to verify:   The entity has a process in place to test the effectiveness of methods used for data discovery.   The process includes verifying the methods are able to discover clear-text PAN on all types of system components and file formats in use. DE.2.5.1.b Examine the results of recent effectiveness tests to verify the effectiveness of methods used for data discovery is confirmed at least annually.	A process to test the effectiveness of the methods used for data discovery ensures the completeness and accuracy of cardholder data detection. For completeness, at least a sampling of system components in both the in- scope and out-of-scope networks should be included in the data-discovery process. Accuracy can be tested by placing test PANs on a sample of system components and file formats in use and confirming that the data- discovery method detected the test PANs.		0

DE.2.5.2	DE.2.5.2 Implement response procedures to be initiated upon the detection of clear- text PAN outside of the CDE to include:   Procedures for determining what to do if clear-text PAN is discovered outside of the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion and/or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable   Procedures for determining how the data ended up outside of the CDE   Procedures for remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the data being outside of the CDE   Procedures for identifying the source of the data   Procedures for identifying whether any track data is stored with the PANs	DE.2.5.2.a Examine documented response procedures to verify that procedures for responding to the detection of clear-text PAN outside of the CDE are defined and include:   Procedures for determining what to do if clear- text PAN is discovered outside of the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion and/or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable   Procedures for determining how the data ended up outside the CDE   Procedures for remediating data leaks or process gaps that resulted in the data being outside of the CDE   Procedures for identifying the source of the data   Procedures for identifying whether any track data is stored with the PANs DE.2.5.2.b Interview personnel and examine records of response actions to verify that remediation activities are performed when clear-text PAN is detected outside of the CD.	Having documented response procedures that are followed in the event clear-text PAN is found outside of the CDE helps to identify the necessary remediation actions and prevent future leaks. For example, if PAN was found outside of the CDE, analysis should be performed to (1) determine whether it was saved independently of other data (or was it part of a full track?), (2) to identify the source of the data, and (3) identify the control gaps that resulted in the data being outside the CD.		0

Mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized loss of clear-text PAN may include appropriate tools—such as data loss prevention (DLP) solutions—and/or manual processes and procedures. Coverage of the mechanisms should include, but not be limited to, e-mails, downloads to removable media, and output to printers. Use of these mechanisms allows an organization to detect and prevent situations that may lead to data loss.		0

Attempts to remove clear-text PAN via an unauthorized channel, method, or process may indicate malicious intent to steal data, or be the actions of an authorized employee who is unaware of or simply not following the proper methods. Timely investigation of these occurrences can identify where remediation needs to be applied and provides valuable information to help understand where the threats are coming from.		0

In addition, personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions and responses to the failure should be captured in the documented evidence.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.3	DE.3  Validate PCI DSS is incorporated into business-as-usual (BAU) activities.	DE.3.2	DE.3.2 Review hardware and software technologies at least annually to confirm whether they continue to meet the organization’s PCI DSS requirements. (For example, a review of technologies that are no longer supported by the vendor and/or no longer meet the security needs of the organization.) The process includes a plan for remediating technologies that no longer meet the organization’s PCI DSS requirements, up to and including replacement of the technology, as appropriate. PCI DSS Reference: Requirement 2, 6	DE.3.2.a Examine documented policies and procedures and interview personnel to verify processes are  defined and implemented to review hardware and software technologies to confirm whether they continue to meet the organization’s PCI DSS requirements. DE.3.2.b Review the results of the recent reviews to verify reviews are performed at least annually. DE.3.2.c For any technologies that have been determined to no longer meet the organization’s PCI DSS requirements, verify a plan is in place to remediate the technology.	Hardware and software technologies are constantly evolving, and organizations need to be aware of changes to the technologies they use, as well as the evolving threats to those technologies. Organizations also need to be aware of changes made by technology vendors to their products or support processes, to understand how such changes may impact the organization’s use of the technology. Regular reviews of technologies that impact or influence PCI DSS controls can assist with purchasing, usage, and deployment strategies, and ensures controls that rely on those technologies remain effective.		0

DE.3.3	DE.3.3 Perform reviews at least quarterly to verify BAU activities are being followed. Reviews must be performed by personnel assigned to the PCI DSS compliance program (as identified in DE.1.3), and include the following:    Confirmation that all BAU activities (e.g., DE.2.2, DE.2.6, and DE.3.1) are being performed    Confirmation that personnel are following security policies and operational procedures (for example, daily log reviews, firewall rule-set reviews, configuration standards for new systems, etc.)    Documenting how the reviews were completed, including how all BAU activities were verified as being in place.    Collection of documented evidence as required for the annual PCI DSS assessment     Review and sign off of results by personnel assigned responsibility for the PCI DSS compliance program (as identified in DE.1.3)  Retention of records and documentation for at least 12 months, covering all BAU activities PCI DSS Reference: Requirements 1-12	DE.3.3.a Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for reviewing and verifying BAU activities. Verify the procedures include:    Confirming that all BAU activities (e.g., DE.2.2, DE.2.6, and DE.3.1) are being performed    Confirming that personnel are following security policies and operational procedures (for example, daily log reviews, firewall rule-set reviews, configuration standards for new systems, etc.)  Documenting how the reviews were completed, including how all BAU activities were verified as being in place    Collecting documented evidence as required for the annual PCI DSS assessment    Reviewing and sign off of results by executive management assigned responsibility for PCI DSS governance    Retaining records and documentation for at least 12 months, covering all BAU activities DE.3.3.b Interview responsible personnel and examine records of reviews to verify that:    Reviews are performed by personnel assigned to the PCI DSS compliance program    Reviews are performed at least quarterly	Implementing PCI DSS controls into business- as-usual activities is an effective method to ensure security is included as part of normal business operations on an ongoing basis. Therefore, it is important that independent checks are performed to ensure BAU controls are active and working as intended. The intent of these independent checks is to review the evidence that confirms business-as- usual activities are being performed. These reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained—for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, firewall reviews, etc.—to assist the entity’s preparation for its next PCI DSS assessment.		0

DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.5	DE.5  Identify and respond to suspicious events.	DE.5	DE.5.1 Implement a methodology for the timely identification of attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems—for example, using coordinated manual reviews and/or centrally-managed or automated log correlation tools—to include at least the following:    Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as they occur    Issuance of timely alerts upon detection of suspicious activity or anomaly to responsible personnel    Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures PCI DSS Reference: Requirements 10, 12	DE.5.1.a Review documentation and interview personnel to verify a methodology is defined and implemented to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems in a timely manner, and includes the following:    Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as they occur    Issuance of timely alerts to responsible personnel    Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures DE.5.1.b Examine incident response procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that:    On-call personnel receive timely alerts.    Alerts are responded to per documented response procedures.	The ability to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems is critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something goes wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without a process to corroborate information from critical system components, and systems that perform security functions—such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and file-integrity monitoring (FIM) systems. Thus, logs for all critical systems components and systems that perform security functions should be collected, correlated, and maintained. This could include the use of software products and service methodologies to provide real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting—such as security information and event management (SIEM), file-integrity monitoring (FIM), or change detection.		0
DE	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation	DE.5	DE.5  Identify and respond to suspicious events.	DE.5.1	DE.5.1 Implement a methodology for the timely identification of attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems—for example, using coordinated manual reviews and/or centrally-managed or automated log correlation tools—to include at least the following:    Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as they occur    Issuance of timely alerts upon detection of suspicious activity or anomaly to responsible personnel    Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures PCI DSS Reference: Requirements 10, 12	DE.5.1.a Review documentation and interview personnel to verify a methodology is defined and implemented to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems in a timely manner, and includes the following:    Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as they occur    Issuance of timely alerts to responsible personnel    Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures DE.5.1.b Examine incident response procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that:    On-call personnel receive timely alerts.    Alerts are responded to per documented response procedures.	The ability to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems is critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something goes wrong.
