  <p class="mb-2">
   The CMMC framework is a security standard developed by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to protect its systems and networks from cyberattacks. The goal of the CMMC framework is to ensure that all contractors, subcontractors, and vendors that are doing business with the DoD have appropriate levels of cybersecurity measures in place.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">

The CMMC framework consists of three levels, ranging from basic cyber hygiene to advanced cyber practices. Each level has a set of best practices and controls that must be implemented in order to meet the requirements of the CMMC. For instance, Level 1 requires basic cyber hygiene measures such as patch management, user access controls, and encryption. 
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">

The DoD requires all contractors and vendors doing business with the DoD to be certified at the appropriate CMMC level. This certification process includes a review of the contractor’s or vendor’s cybersecurity practices and controls. The DoD also requires all contractors and vendors to be audited every three years to ensure that the appropriate level of security is being maintained.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">

The CMMC framework is an important step in protecting the networks and systems of the DoD. By requiring contractors and vendors to implement strong cybersecurity measures, the DoD is better able to protect its systems and data from malicious actors. It also helps to ensure that contractors and vendors are held accountable for their security practices.

The CMMC framework is an important tool in ensuring the security of the DoD’s systems and networks. By requiring contractors and vendors to implement appropriate levels of cybersecurity, the DoD is better able to protect its data from malicious actors. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, the CMMC framework will remain an important part of the DoD’s cybersecurity strategy.
