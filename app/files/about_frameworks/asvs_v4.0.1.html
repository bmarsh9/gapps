  <p class="mb-2">
The Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a security framework that is used to define security requirements for applications and APIs. It was developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to provide a consistent set of security requirements that can be used to evaluate the security of applications and APIs.
</p><p class="mb-2">
The ASVS was designed to provide a comprehensive set of security requirements that can be used to evaluate the security of an application or API. It is divided into three different levels (Level 1, 2, and 3) each of which provides a different level of security assurance. Level 1 is the most basic level, and is designed to cover basic security requirements such as authentication, authorization, input validation, and output encoding. Level 2 covers more advanced security requirements such as authentication and authorization methods, encryption, and logging. Level 3 covers the most comprehensive security requirements, including application firewalls, authentication and authorization methods, encryption, logging, and audit trails.
</p><p class="mb-2">
The ASVS provides a comprehensive set of security requirements that can be used to ensure that applications and APIs are secure. It is important to note that the ASVS is not a replacement for traditional security testing, but rather should be used in addition to traditional security testing. Additionally, the ASVS is not a silver bullet and cannot guarantee secure applications and APIs, but it does provide a framework for assessing the security of applications and APIs.
